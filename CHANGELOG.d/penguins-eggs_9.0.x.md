The same happen on gwaydroid and kwaydroid: both are actually using accessiries. in this case, it's evident who - a future accessory waydroid, specifyng that it's need and mantained from tha authors - can lead to a better compatibility and free us to configure it twice.

### eggs-9.0.23-1

### eggs-9.0.18
* renamed blissos theme to waydroid, moved egg-of-ubuntu-impish-waydroid and egg-of-debian-bookworm-waydroid together under the same place: [waydroid](https://sourceforge.net/projects/penguins-eggs/files/iso/waydroid/), due the strong affinity.

### eggs-9.0.16
* ```eggs produce``` just remove users accounts and home. This let to have working servers examples;
* ```eggs produce --backup``` remove servers and users data from live, and put them on a LUKS volume.

From version 9.0.16 we have two new commands: ```eggs syncfrom``` (alias restore) and ```eggs syncto``` (alias backup).

A working installation, can easily sync users and servers data to a luks-eggs-backup:
* ```eggs syncto -f /tmp/luks-eggs-backup``` backup users and servers data to LUKS volume /tmp/luks-eggs-backup:

A new installation, can easyly get users and servers data from a luks-eggs-backup:
* ```eggs syncfrom from -f /tmp/luks-eggs-backup``` restore users and servers data from the LUKS volume /tmp/luks-eggs-backup.

**NOTE:** 
* krill: ```sudo eggs install --cli``` will restore users and servers data automatically;
* installing with calamares: when installation is finished, you need to mount the rootdir of your installed system and, give the following command: ```sudo eggs syncfrom -f /path/to/luks-eggs-backup -r /path/to/rootdir```
* it's possbile actually to change the nest directory, editing configuration file ```/etc/penguins-eggs.d/eggs.yaml```. Example: ```set snapshot_dir: '/opt/eggs/'```, but you can't use the following: /etc, /boot, /usr and /var.

**DISCLAIM:** using this new feature can be dangerous for your data:
* ```syncfrom``` replace all users homes and all servers homes with data from the luck-eggs-backup, Force this data in not appropriate system can easily end in a long disaster recovery;
* I want stress you again on the fact we are working with a **live filesystem** mounted binded to the **REAL filesystem**. This mean who removing a directory under the nest, usually ```/nest/ovarium/filesystem.squashfs```, mean remove it from the REAL filesystem. So, if something went wrong during the iso production and You remain with live filesystem again binded, the shortest way to solve the problem is simply reboot.

### eggs-9.0.15
--backup option: a new common command restore was added it will be be used inside krill (OK) or calamares (to do)

### eggs-9.0.14
--backup option: set minimun luks volume size to 128 MB; it's possible to move nest under /opt

### eggs-9.0.12
--backup option: save users and SERVERS datas in LUKS volume inside ISO, then can be restored by krill. 

### eggs-9.0.11
--backup option: users homes and configurations are saved in LUKS volume inside ISO, then restored by krill.

### eggs-9.0.0
* An Epiphany present! 

### eggs-9.0.0-BETA
* A Christmas present! 

A preview of eggs version 9.x! Even if the aspect remains substantially unchanged, internally a lot has changed: we have moved to node 16 and the new version of oclif. Everything has been done to create a way to manage even more distributions, not only Debian, Devuan, Ubuntu and derivatives, but also Fedora and Arch Linux. This version however does NOT yet include Fedora, nor Arch Linux, I have to solve the problems related to the use of dracut instead of initramfs-tools of Debian.

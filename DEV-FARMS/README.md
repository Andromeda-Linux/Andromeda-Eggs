# DEV-FARMS

It is possible to install penguins-eggs from zero and without the native package.

This way is a need for fedora and opensuse where we don't have yet a package, but can be used with all.

The limit is, a system made with this procedure can be updated just with the same procedure, becouse package manager don't know at all it.

But this way is very pratical during development, no need to build package to test and often is long enought and tedius.

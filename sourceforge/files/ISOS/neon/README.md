# user/password
* ```live/evolution```
* ```root/evolution```

All ISOs include eggs, you can udate it with: ```sudo eggs update```.

# KDE Neon
* **egg-of-neon-jammy-user** - a remaster of neon-user-20230214-1145.iso with eggs, unchanded. 

* **egg-of-neon-jammy--developer** - a remaster of neon-user-20221020-0947.iso plus tools to develop eggs.

# Installing KDE Neon via PXE

One feature of ISO images made with eggs is the ability to be used for network installation . All you have to do is boot the ISO to be installed, open a terminal window and type the command: 

```sudo eggs cuckoo```.

Then all you have to do is boot from the network the machines to be installed and start the calamares or krill installer.

You can also perform an unattended installation with krill, see the [manual](https://penguins-eggs.net/docs/Tutorial/english) or, find assistance in the [telegram Penguins' eggs](https://t.me/penguins_eggs) group.

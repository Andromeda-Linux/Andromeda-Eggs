# Penguins' eggs remastered ISOs

All ISOs are based on Ubuntu bionic

# user/password
* ```live/evolution```
* ```root/evolution```

All the ISOs include nodejs and eggs installed (.npm package), so you can update your eggs tool with the command:

```sudo eggs update```

# Ubuntu
Ubuntu is a Linux distribution based on Debian mostly composed of free and open-source software. Ubuntu is officially released in three editions: Desktop, Server, and Core for Internet of things devices and robots. All the editions can run on the computer alone, or in a virtual machine. Ubuntu is a popular operating system for cloud computing, with support for OpenStack. Ubuntu's default desktop has been GNOME, since version 17.10.

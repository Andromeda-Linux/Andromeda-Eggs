# Penguins' eggs remastered ISOs

All ISOs are based on Ubuntu 22.04 jammy

# user/password
* ```live/evolution```
* ```root/evolution```

All the ISOs include nodejs and eggs installed (.npm package), so you can update your eggs tool with the command:

```sudo eggs update```

# Ubuntu

Ubuntu is a popular operating system for cloud computing, with support for OpenStack. Ubuntu's default desktop has been GNOME, since version 17.10.

# Jammy
Released on april 2022.

## **naked**
Just the juice, without GUI. You can start here to build your revolution!

Note: I didn't find a clean way to get a clean Ubuntu 22.04 CLI only as I do with Debian/Devuan, I tryed with Ubuntu server edition minumun and stardard installation, but always there are delay on start of the live due a wait for networking. If someone know the issue can be kind do advice me for the problem.

##  **colibri**
A light xfce4 for developers you can easily start to improve eggs installing colibri.

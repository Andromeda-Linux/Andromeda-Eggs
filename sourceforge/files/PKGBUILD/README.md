# eggs-pkgbuilds
 
This is my [eggs-pkgbuilds](https://github.com/pieroproietti/eggs-pkgbuilds) repository, and here I am collecting my PKGBUILDs. Once tested, pkgbuilds are published to the [Archlinux User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/penguins-eggs) and [Manjaro Community Repository](https://gitlab.manjaro.org/packages/community/penguins-eggs).

That is - for me - half automatic thanks to mantainers' work.

# Installation

It's possible to install **penguins-eggs** from [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/penguins-eggs) adding repo [Chaotic-AUR](https://aur.chaotic.cx/) and using `sudo pacman -Sy penguins-eggs`.

**calamares-eggs** is not in aur and is not necessary in manjaro. To install it, just download the file and use `pacman -U name-file` to install.

# More informations
There is a [Penguins' eggs official guide](https://penguins-eggs.net/docs/Tutorial/eggs-users-guide) and same other documentation - mostly for developers - on the repository [penguins-eggs](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs) under [DOCUMENTATION](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs/tree/master/DOCUMENTATION). I want to point out [hens, differents species](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs/blob/master/documents/hens-different-species.md) a brief how to use eggs in Debian. Arch and Manjaro, and the post [Arch-naked](https://penguins-eggs.net/docs/Tutorial/archlinux-naked.html) on the blog which describes how to create an Arch naked live, install it, then dress the resulting system with a graphics development station.
